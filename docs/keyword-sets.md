# Keyword Sets

Keyword sets allow you to group together commonly used keywords so that you can easily [select](selecting-keywords.md) them with the click of a button. For example, if you frequently need to keyword photos of trains, you may want to have a keyword set named "Trains" that contains keywords like "train", "railroad", "freight train", and other train-related words.

To view and manage your keyword sets, click the Keyword Sets view button on the left panel. Once you've got a set of keywords defined, you can quickly [select](selecting-keywords.md) them by clicking on the keyword.
