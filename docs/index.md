# What is Keyword Complete?
Keyword Complete is a workflow-based system for efficiently keywording your photos. Create your own keyword hierarchy to generate a rich set of keywords with minimal typing. Don't worry about compatibility with your existing tools; it's designed to be used side-by-side with them.  Use it to generate your keywords which you can copy and paste back into your photo management app.

### Supported Operating Systems
* Desktop
  * Windows 10, version 1809 or higher

# How does it work?
The power of Keyword Complete comes from the data contained in the [keyword hierarchy](keyword-hierarchy.md). The more structured your keyword hierarchy is, and the more detail it contains, the faster you'll be able to get a detailed set of relevant generated keywords. Take some time to work on your hierarchy and learn more about so-called controlled vocabularies at sites such as [photo-keywords.com](https://www.photo-keywords.com) and [controlledvocabulary.com](http://controlledvocabulary.com). Already have a keyword hierarchy defined in another app? Great! You can easily [import](importing-keywords.md) it into Keyword Complete.

Once you've got a hierarchy defined, you can get on with keywording your photos. Simply [select](selecting-keywords.md) the keywords that already exist in your hierarchy, or add new ones, and each of those keywords will be expanded based on the hierarchy and the keyword's [attributes](keyword-attributes.md). If you've defined a well-structured hierarchy, you barely have to do any typing and you've now got a comprehensive set of keywords that you can copy and paste into your photo management app.
