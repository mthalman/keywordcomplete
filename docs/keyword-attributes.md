# Keyword Attributes

Each keyword has a variety of attributes that influence how the the keyword generation logic works when that keyword is [selected](selecting-keywords.md). These attributes can be set in the keyword editing dialog by right-clicking the keyword in the [hierarchy tree](keyword-hierarchy.md) and selecting "Edit".

| Attibute | Description |
| - | - |
| Name | Pretty self-explanatory here. This is the name of the keyword and will show up in the generated list of keywords when the keyword is [selected](selecting-keywords.md). |
| Synonyms | These are additional terms that you want to be included in the generated list of keywords when the keyword is [selected](selecting-keywords.md). By defining synonyms of a keyword, it means you select just a single keyword and have all of its synonyms generated along with it. |
| Exclude from output | This attribute indicates whether the keyword should be excluded from the generated output when the keyword is [selected](selecting-keywords.md). This is useful for keywords that are defined for organization purposes and do not have names that are suitable for the generated output. An example of this is if you had a keyword named "Plant" so you could organize various plant-related keywords but don't actually want "Plant" to be included in the output because it's too general. |
| Related Keywords | This is a very powerful feature of Keyword Complete that allows a keyword to reference another keyword somewhere else in the hierarchy. |
