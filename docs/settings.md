# Settings

The Settings panel allows you to configure the options of the app and manage the database. To open the Settings panel, click the Settings button with the gear icon in the lower-left part of the window.

## Options

| Option | Description |
| - | - |
| Prompt to set state for new keywords | When enabled, you will be prompted with a dialog box to configure a keyword's attributes whenever you attempt to add a new keyword in a keyword lookup box. If this option is disabled, adding a new keyword in a keyword lookup box would automatically add it as a root keyword and not prompt you to set its attributes. |

## Import Keywords

A button is provided here that allows you to import keywords into the database. See [Importing Keywords](importing-keywords.md) for more info.

## Manage Database

This section contains buttons that allow you to backup and restore your database as well as to reset it entirely (this will wipe out all your data).
